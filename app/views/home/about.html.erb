      <h3>About Hearno</h3>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>Hearno is a photobooth app where users can build a photostrip showing their expressions of the phrase, "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil." See more about the origins of the phrase in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_no_evil,_hear_no_evil,_speak_no_evil">Three wise monkeys on wikipedia</a>. The phrase means different things to many, and we find it interesting how people interpret it and apply it to their lives.
        </p>
        <blockquote class="pull-right">Just as there is disagreement about the origin of the phrase, there are differing explanations of the meaning of "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil."
          <ul>
            <li>In Buddhist tradition, the tenets of the proverb are about not dwelling on evil thoughts.</li>
            <li>In the Western world both the proverb and the image are often used to refer to a lack of moral responsibility on the part of people who refuse to acknowledge impropriety, looking the other way or feigning ignorance.</li>
            <li>It may also signify a code of silence in gangs, or organised crime.</li>
          </ul>

        <p>
Given we are from the western world, we identify with the second explanation, which often is used to describe censoring information in a effort to, "look the other way." It is something both governments and <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/sites/default/files/images/billboards%20%203_0.jpg?1361338873">media</a> are often accused of. The phrase evokes images of censorship and restricting access to information, it has even been used to encourage <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Oak_Ridge_Wise_Monkeys.jpg">secrecy of government employees</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Hearno believes having the facts and trustable data is necessary for a true democracy. We believe that trying to censor information because we want to "speak no evil" or others want to avoid uncomfortable truths and "hear no evil" is a disservice to the people. A short sighted policy that restricts freedom people and can be ripe for abuse.
        </p>
        <p>Which is why Hearno wants to spread peoples expressions of the phrase and bring more attention to the cause of censorship around the world. The site has shares information about various organizations fighting censorship in the US or around the world. Hearno doesn't directly take donations, but promote groups that do which we support. Make a photo strip depicting youself, friends, objects, organizations, or anything that represents the phase "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil." Then share the strips via email and social networks to spread the word, and make others reflect on what "see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil" means to them.
